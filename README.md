Repo for CSC 413 : Internet and Web Technology (c) IBBU Lapai, Nigeria

This will be the repo where I would share Lab activities and reference materials for this course.


For Lecture slides, some guides on what we do in class and even more excercises, please visit http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193x/lectures/

Goodluck!
